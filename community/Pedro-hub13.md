### About 
<i>
<br/>

I'm Pedro, a driven Data Analyst fueled by nearly four years of unwavering passion for my craft. My journey into Data has been one of continuous growth and dedication to mastering the field. As I near the completion of my computer science degree, I find myself equipped with a sharpened logical mind, a vital tool in dissecting and interpreting complex data sets.

In my toolkit, I wield powerful instruments: PySpark, enabling me to navigate the vast expanses of Big Data; Power BI and LookerStudio, my go-to platforms for crafting visually stunning and informative dashboards; and SQL, my trusted companion for querying extensive databases. Yet, my expertise transcends mere technical proficiency.

I pride myself on my ability to transform raw data into compelling narratives, enriching presentations that resonate with directors and coordinators of client companies. With each project, I not only analyze data but also shape the insights that drive decision-making, positioning myself as an invaluable asset in the realm of data-driven business strategy.
