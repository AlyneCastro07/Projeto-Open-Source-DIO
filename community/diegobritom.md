I am a data enthusiast specializing in database administration and DataViz. I have solid experience in Business Intelligence (BI) projects, developing reports for Petrobras, the Federal Court of Accounts (TCU), and others, using tools like Power BI and Excel.

Over the past two years, I have honed my skills in understanding business needs, developing solutions in collaboration with technical teams, data modeling, and creating dashboards and KPIs. I am proficient in Microsoft SQL Server, Power BI, MS Office, and Knime Analytics, as well as SQL and DAX languages.

I work with agile methodologies such as Scrum and hold certifications including PL-300 Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst, DP-900, and ITIL V4. Additionally, I speak advanced Spanish, thanks to an exchange program, and have intermediate conversational skills in English.

I am always looking to enhance my skills and contribute with innovative solutions for data analysis and visualization.
